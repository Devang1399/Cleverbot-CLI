Made for Mac OS X. Tested on Mac OS 10.9.3 using python 2.7.6.

Note: It should not work on other unix/linux/BSD systems or on python versions less then 2.7 or with python3.

Dependancies:
	A working internet connection
	PyAudio
	And maybe some other modules if they are not included in the standard python modules.
	Check the imports in cleverbot.py and listener.py and make sure you have all those modules.
	You should be able to install any module with pip or easy_install. i.e. easy_install pyaudio

Running:
	In Terminal.app or something similar run:
	 python cleverbot.py
	
	Note: It must be run in the directory extracted from the zip. a.k.a cleverbot.py must be in the same directory as listener.py and chatterbotapi.pyc

Usage:
	This is a command line application.
	
	To use, follow the steps in Running. Then follow the prompts within the application.

	If choosing to use speech recognition, you will need a microphone.
	Note: You may need to get close to your laptop if you choose to use any built it microphone.
